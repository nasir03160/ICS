"""
Malware Simulation Framework - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

This software is designed to simulate malware behavior in a controlled environment
for educational and research purposes. DO NOT use this in a production environment
or against systems without explicit permission.

Safety measures:
1. All simulations are run in sandbox mode by default
2. No actual system compromises are attempted
3. Data exfiltration only goes to specified test server
4. Worm propagation is simulated but not executed

Usage:
python malware_simulation.py --userid "test" --mode "all" --sandbox

Modes:
- keylogger: Simulates keystroke logging
- data_stealing: Simulates sensitive data collection
- persistence: Simulates malware persistence techniques
- worm: Simulates worm-like network propagation
- av_evasion: Tests anti-virus evasion techniques
- all: Runs all simulation components



Use PyArmor to obfuscate Python code and PyInstaller to compile into an executable.
